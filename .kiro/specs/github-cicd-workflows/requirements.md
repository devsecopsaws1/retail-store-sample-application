# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create GitHub Actions workflows for the retail store sample application to implement a complete CI/CD pipeline. The workflows will detect changes in individual microservices, build and push Docker images to Amazon ECR, and automatically update Helm chart values with new image tags. This enables GitOps-based deployment where ArgoCD can automatically sync the updated configurations to the Kubernetes cluster.

The retail store application consists of 5 microservices (ui, catalog, cart, orders, checkout) that need independent CI/CD pipelines to support efficient development and deployment practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD workflows that detect changes to specific microservices, so that only modified services are built and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes changes to any file in `src/ui/` THEN the system SHALL trigger the UI service workflow
2. WHEN a developer pushes changes to any file in `src/catalog/` THEN the system SHALL trigger the catalog service workflow  
3. WHEN a developer pushes changes to any file in `src/cart/` THEN the system SHALL trigger the cart service workflow
4. WHEN a developer pushes changes to any file in `src/orders/` THEN the system SHALL trigger the orders service workflow
5. WHEN a developer pushes changes to any file in `src/checkout/` THEN the system SHALL trigger the checkout service workflow
6. WHEN changes are made to files outside service directories THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger unnecessary service builds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker images to be automatically built and pushed to Amazon ECR, so that the latest code changes are available for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service workflow is triggered THEN the system SHALL build a Docker image using the service's Dockerfile
2. WHEN building the Docker image THEN the system SHALL tag it with the Git commit SHA for traceability
3. WHEN the Docker build is successful THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Amazon ECR using AWS credentials
4. WHEN authenticated with ECR THEN the system SHALL push the tagged image to the appropriate ECR repository
5. WHEN the ECR repository does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
6. WHEN the image push fails THEN the system SHALL fail the workflow and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Helm chart values to be automatically updated with new image tags, so that ArgoCD can deploy the latest versions without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Docker image is successfully pushed to ECR THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding Helm chart values.yaml file
2. WHEN updating the values.yaml THEN the system SHALL replace the image.tag field with the new commit SHA
3. WHEN updating the values.yaml THEN the system SHALL update the image.repository field to point to the private ECR repository
4. WHEN the values.yaml is updated THEN the system SHALL commit the changes back to the repository
5. WHEN committing changes THEN the system SHALL use a clear commit message indicating the service and new image tag
6. WHEN the commit is pushed THEN ArgoCD SHALL detect the changes and sync the updated configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to use secure authentication methods and follow security best practices, so that the deployment process is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating with AWS THEN the system SHALL use GitHub Secrets for AWS credentials
2. WHEN accessing ECR THEN the system SHALL use temporary credentials with minimal required permissions
3. WHEN building Docker images THEN the system SHALL scan for security vulnerabilities
4. WHEN pushing to the repository THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated service account or bot token
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL NOT expose credentials in logs or outputs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visibility into the CI/CD pipeline status and results, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow runs THEN the system SHALL provide clear status indicators for each step
2. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and logs
3. WHEN a workflow succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the built image tag and updated chart information
4. WHEN multiple services are updated simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent workflows without conflicts
5. WHEN viewing workflow history THEN developers SHALL be able to trace deployments back to specific commits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want the CI/CD pipeline to be efficient and cost-effective, so that development velocity is maximized while minimizing resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no changes are detected for a service THEN the system SHALL NOT run unnecessary builds
2. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL use Docker layer caching to reduce build times
3. WHEN running workflows THEN the system SHALL use appropriate runner sizes for the workload
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary resources
5. WHEN multiple commits are pushed rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle workflow queuing appropriately
